# Layer Labs Contributor License Agreement

This Contributor License Agreement (this "**Agreement**" or "**CLA**") sets forth the terms under which You will contribute or otherwise make certain Contributions available to Layer Labs, Inc. ("**Layer Labs**" or "**Layer**"). By agreeing to the terms and conditions of this CLA, you accept that these terms and conditions will apply to current and future Contributions You submit to Layer Labs. This CLA will not change or limit Your rights to use Your Contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions

1. **"You"** or **"Your"** means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Layer Labs. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. **"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Layer Labs for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Layer Labs (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Layer Labs or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Layer Labs for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

3. **"Work"** means any products, software, documentation, or services owned or managed by Layer Labs.

## 2. Grant of Licenses

### 2.1 Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Layer Labs and to recipients of software distributed by Layer Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. You retain ownership of the copyright in Your Contributions and have the same rights to use or license the Contributions which You would have had without entering into this Agreement.

### 2.2 Patent License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Layer Labs and to recipients of software distributed by Layer Labs a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 2.3 Licensing Flexibility
Layer Labs may license Your Contributions under any license, including but not limited to open source licenses (such as MIT, Apache, or GPL), proprietary licenses, or commercial licenses, as Layer Labs deems appropriate for its business needs.

### 2.4 Moral Rights
If moral rights apply to any Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Layer Labs, Layer Labs' successors in interest, or any Layer Labs licensee.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

1. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Layer Labs, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Layer Labs.

2. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

3. You represent and warrant that Your grant of rights under this Agreement does not violate any grant of rights which You have made to third parties, including Your employer(s).

4. You represent and warrant that You will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing Your obligations under this Agreement.

## 4. Third-Party Submissions

Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Layer Labs separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

## 5. Support and Warranties

1. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all.

2. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

3. Layer Labs acknowledges that it is not obligated to use Your Contribution.

## 6. Notification of Changes

You agree to notify Layer Labs of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make any of the representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

## 7. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Layer Labs and its officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising from or relating to your breach of any representations and warranties in this Agreement.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR LAYER LABS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

## 9. Miscellaneous

### 9.1 Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Cayman Islands, excluding its conflicts of law provisions.

### 9.3 Assignment
If You or Layer Labs assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and obligations in the Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

### 9.4 Severability
If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

### 9.5 Waiver
No course of dealing on the part of Layer Labs or Layer Labs' officers, agents, or representatives, nor any failure or delay in the exercise of any right by Layer Labs, shall operate as a waiver thereof, and any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude any later exercise of any such right.
